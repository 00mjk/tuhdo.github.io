#+TITLE: Exploring large projects with Projectile and Helm Projectile

Let's start with a few demos.

* Demos

In the demo, a few files are narrowed and marked, then opened. I ran
=helm-mini= to display a list of opened =txt= files.

** Open file at point anywhere

Demo (begins when ~START DEMO~ appears in minibuffer):

[[file:static/helm-projectile/helm-projectile-find-files-dwim-1.gif][file:static/helm-projectile/helm-projectile-find-files-dwim-1.gif]]

As you can see in the demo, Projectile can jump anywhere, even if
there's only a filename without path. It works everywhere, even in
text file.

- In the demo, the first path is a file that I opened using a command
  from *M-x*.
- The second path is a directory that I opened using a key binding.
- The third path is highlighted in a region and I opened using command
  history in Helm, so no need to type anything.
** Delete files anywhere
:PROPERTIES:

:END:
Demo (begins when ~START DEMO~ appears in minibuffer):

[[file:static/helm-projectile/helm-projectile-find-file-delete.gif][file:static/helm-projectile/helm-projectile-find-file-delete.gif]]

As you see, you don't have to navigate to a file to delete it. All
project files are always at your finger tip for you to delete!

** Switch between current file and other files with same names but different extensions

Demo (begins when ~START DEMO~ appears in minibuffer):

[[file:static/helm-projectile/helm-projectile-find-other-file.gif][file:static/helm-projectile/helm-projectile-find-other-file.gif]]

- First, I select ~helm-projectile-find-other-file~ and a list of
  other files displayed.
- Then, I marked a few files and press *RET* to open all.
- Finally, I use =helm-mini= to open a list of opened buffers and
  the files I marked and opened are there.

* What is Projectile?

From the homepage:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Projectile is a project interaction library for Emacs. Its goal is to
provide a nice set of features operating on a project level without
introducing external dependencies(when feasible). For instance -
finding project files has a portable implementation written in pure
Emacs Lisp without the use of GNU find (but for performance sake an
indexing mechanism backed by external commands exists as well).

Projectile tries to be practical - portability is great, but if some
external tools could speed up some task substantially and the tools
are available, Projectile will leverage them.

By default, ~git~, ~mercurial~, ~darcs~ and ~bazaar~ are considered
projects. So are ~lein~, ~maven~, ~sbt~, ~scons~, ~rebar~ and
~bundler~. If you want to mark a folder manually as a project just
create an empty ~.projectile~ file in it.
#+END_QUOTE

I will help you quickly benefit from Projectile and
~helm-projectile~ - an extension of Projectile that uses ~helm~
interface for many Projectile commands that provides even more
features not available in stock Projectile - in a practical task
like exploring the Linux kernel.

This tutorial is about how to use Projectile along with Helm. There
are other completion systems such as ~grizzl~ or ~ido~ with ~flx~, both use
fuzzy finding. Helm also does almost the same thing, except instead of
fuzzy matching, Helm uses regex matching and provides more features
beyond matching. If you do not like Helm, just follow this tutorial,
then change completion system to your preference later.

* Installation and configuration
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       c85c6d2f-d00d-41ef-8f07-3d52d23c92a6
:END:
You also install Projectile via MELPA and setup:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (projectile-global-mode)
  (setq projectile-completion-system 'helm)
  (helm-projectile-on)
#+end_src

All Projectile commands has prefix ~C-c p~.

* All-in-one command: ~helm-projectile~, *C-c p h*
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       cd4cc853-affb-4b2a-a894-55a583c9b756
:END:
_Usage_: This command, by default, is the combination of these 5 commands:

- ~helm-projectile-switch-project~
- ~helm-projectile-switch-to-buffer~
- ~helm-projectile-recentf~
- ~helm-projectile-find-file~
- ~helm-projectile-find-dir~

It's really convenient when you have an all-in-one command, so you
don't have to remember many different key bindings. However, in large
projects, displaying all listings for commands can be slow.  If you
work with large projects, displaying all sources in ~helm-projectile~
can be slow. In that case, you should only use two sources:
~helm-source-projectile-projects~ and
~helm-source-projectile-files-list~. The first display a list of
projects and the second displays the current files in the selected
project.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (setq helm-projectile-sources-list '(helm-source-projectile-projects
                                       helm-source-projectile-files-list))
#+end_src

* Enter project portal: ~helm-projectile-switch-project~, *C-c p p*
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       8ed44f1d-2b07-4c3d-b11b-f6e72f5eeded
:END:
_Usage_: This is the very first command you need to use before using other
commands, because it is the entrance to all of your projects and the
only command that can be used outside of a project. The command 
lists all visited projects. If you first use Projectile, you have to
visit at least a project supported by Projectile to let it remember
the location of this project. The next time you won't have to manually
navigate to that project but jump to it instantly using
~helm-projectile-switch-project~.

[[file:static/helm-projectile/helm-projectile-switch-project.gif][file:static/helm-projectile/helm-projectile-switch-project.gif]]

Available actions:

- /Switch to project/ (default action, bound to *RET*): Switch to a
  project and execute an action specified in
  ~projectile-switch-project-action~ variable. This variable stores a
  command to be executed after a project is selected. The default is
  ~projectile-find-file~. My suggestion is to bind it to
  ~helm-projectile-find-file~, as it provides the same thing as
  ~projectile-find-file~ but with more feature:

  #+begin_src emacs-lisp
    (setq projectile-switch-project-action 'helm-projectile-find-file)
  #+end_src

  Even better, you should bind it to ~helm-projectile~. When the action
  is ~helm-projectile~, this can be done: *open files in other
  projects without ever leaving current working project*. It is 
  achieved by opening another ~helm-projectile~ session, but for
  another project, because ~helm-projectile~ always includes a list of
  projects, and makes ~helm-projectile~ list files in that project.
  This is not possible with normal Projectile with other completion
  systems, because other completion systems can only display one list
  at a time:

  #+begin_src emacs-lisp
    (setq projectile-switch-project-action 'helm-projectile)
  #+end_src

  Demo (begin when ~START DEMO~ appears in minibuffer):

  [[file:static/helm-projectile/helm-projectile-1.gif][file:static/helm-projectile/helm-projectile-1.gif]]

  + First, from the file ~MAINTAINERS~, I ran
    ~helm-projectile~. Notice that the current project I'm working is
    at the top of project list.

  + Then, I moved the highlight bar to =~/.emacs.d= project and press
    *RET*. Now, =~/.emacs.d= is at the top of project list, indicating
    it is inside that project. Normal =projectile-switch-project=
    command does not display the current project, but Helm version
    displays it because you can perform many other useful actions with
    project root directory, such as =grep= the whole project or any
    other actions you learn in this section.

- /Open Dired in project's directory/ (*C-d*)

- /Open project root in vc-dir or magit/ (*M-g*)

- /Switch to Eshell/ (*M-e*): Open a projectin Eshell.

- /Grep in projects/ (*C-s*; add prefix *C-u* to recursive grep): As
  you type the regexp in the mini buffer, the live grep results will
  be displayed incrementally.

- /Compile project/ (*C-c*): Run a ~compile~ command at the project
  root.

* File management
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       b217795d-c945-4a63-8f22-ce7eaf7ebc5d
:END:
** Command: ~helm-projectile-find-file~, *C-c p f*
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       d5bf76c1-08af-4429-83bf-18615cbafb95
:END:
_Usage_: This command lists all files in a project for users to narrow 
down to wanted files. Some frequently used actions that cover open,
rename, copy, delete,search and other miscelaneous operations. Once
you mastered the actions of ~helm-projectile-find-file~, you master
the actions of other commands as well since the actions of other
commands are just a subset of ~helm-projectile-find-file~ actions. All
the key bindings associated with actions are only available while a
Helm buffer is active. You can think of actions as an mini version of
*M-x*: only applicable commands are listed, and even those commands
have key bindings. Prefix argument can be applied, when possible.

The same Helm interface can be used to search for an action. The first
12 actions are bound from *<f1>* to *<f12>*. You can type the index
number to instantly narrow to that action, or simply press respective
key.

*** Open 
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       400557f8-b7a0-4ea7-9744-3d9d3356867d
:END:
- /Find File/ (default action bound to *RET*): open files; if multiple
  files are marked, using either *M-SPC* to mark specific files or all
  marked using *M-a*, all marked files are opened, as in the [[http://tuhdo.github.io/helm-projectile.html#sec-1-1][Select
  and open multiple files]] section.

- /Find file other window/ (*C-c o*): Open file in other window. Very
  useful action and is used in many Helm commands.

  Demo (begins when ~START DEMO~ appears in minibuffer):

  [[file:static/helm-projectile/helm-projectile-find-file-other-window.gif][file:static/helm-projectile/helm-projectile-find-file-other-window.gif]]

  Notice the filename in other window.
  
  Normal Projectile commands have variants for opening
  file/directory/buffer in other window with prefix *C-c 4
  p*. However, you have to make a mental choice which variant to
  use. If you already execute =projectile-find-file= command, and
  suddenly you decided to open in other window, you have to cancel
  current command and execute the whole thing with the other window
  variant =projectile-find-file-other-window= again. Using Helm, you
  don't have to worry about open in current window or other window
  first; you worry about that later when you already decided exact
  files to open.

- /Find file as root/ (*C-x @*): Another really useful action. With
  this command, you don't have to use [[http://www.gnu.org/software/tramp/#Running-eshell-on-a-remote-host][Tramp syntax]] to open file as
  root. Just browse file to anywhere, and when needed, open it as root
  instantly. 

  Demo (begins when ~START DEMO~ appears in minibuffer):

  [[file:static/helm-projectile/helm-projectile-find-file-as-root.gif][file:static/helm-projectile/helm-projectile-find-file-as-root.gif]]

  In the demo, I opened directory ~/etc~ *after* I move to it. No need
  to enter Tramp syntax for =sudo=.

- /Find file other frame/ (*C-c C-o*): Open file in another frame.

- /Find File in Dired/: Open file directory in Dired.

- /Find file in hex dump/: Open file using [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Editing-Binary-Files.html][hexl]].

- /View file/: Open file for read-only.

- /Open file externally/ (*C-c C-x*, add prefix *C-u* to choose a
  program): Open file using external applications. Once an application
  is selected, it is remembered as default application for the
  selected file type.

*** Move and Rename
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       df231b0d-9a59-45b0-9b29-6f47ff19ff55
:END:
- /Rename file(s)/ (*M-R*): Rename marked files. To mark files, press
  *M-SPC*. You must have two buffers side by side: one is a buffer
  that is running current ~helm-projectile-find-file~ command and
  another is destination buffer. When this action is executed, it
  copies marked files to the directory of destination buffers.

  Demo (begins when ~START DEMO~ appears in minibuffer):

  [[file:static/helm-projectile/helm-projectile-rename-file.gif][file:static/helm-projectile/helm-projectile-rename-file.gif]]

  In the demo, I selected a set of files in
  =helm-projectile-find-file= then press *M-R* to rename files to the
  directory of the right buffer, =~/test_dir=.

- /Serial rename files/: Rename multiple files at once to the same
  name differentiated by the index at the end, and move files to a
  prompted directory. If there is a buffer in other window, default to
  the directory of that buffer.

  Demo (begins when ~START DEMO~ appears in minibuffer):

  [[file:static/helm-projectile/helm-projectile-serial-rename-file.gif][file:static/helm-projectile/helm-projectile-serial-rename-file.gif]]

- /Serial rename by symlinking files/: Similar to ~Serial rename
  files~ but create symbolic links instead.

- /Serial rename by copying files/: Similar to ~Serial rename files~
  but copy files instead.

*** Copy and Delete
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       0276d133-1547-4c46-a598-324add5eeb27
:END:
- /Copy file(s)/ (*M-C*): similar to ~Rename File(s)~ action but copy
  marked files.

- /Delete File(s)/ (*M-D* or *C-c d*): similar to ~Rename File(s)~
  action but delete marked files. With =helm-projectile=, you can stay
  where you are and delete files anywhere in your project. This is
  demonstrated at the beginning: [[http://tuhdo.github.io/helm-projectile.html#sec-1-3][Delete files anywhere]].

*** Search and Replace
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       bb0e3512-f3f1-42c2-80ec-50d47fc7ba57
:END:

- /Grep File(s)/ (*C-s*; add prefix *C-u* for recursive grep): ~grep~
  current highlighted file or marked files. With prefix *C-u*,
  recursively ~grep~ parent directories of marked files. Remember, it
  only works on marked files, or the current file the highlight bar is
  on.

- /Zgrep/ (*M-g z*; add prefix *C-u* for recursive zgrep): Similar to
  ~grep~ but invokes ~grep~ on compressed or gzipped files.

- /Locate/ (*C-x C-f*, add *C-u* to specify locate db): Search using
  ~locate~, the same as [[http://tuhdo.github.io/helm-intro.html#sec-12][helm-locate]].

*** Miscelaneous
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       3822d245-6836-469d-bc2f-45a0a6e4b941
:END:
- /Insert as org link/ (*C-c @*): Insert the current file that
  highlight bar is on as an Org link.

- /Ediff File/ (*C-=*): If only a file is marked (that is the line
  your Helm highlight bar is on), it prompts for another file to
  compare. If two files are marked, starts an Ediff session between
  two files. More than two files are marked, you are prompted for
  another file to compare again.

  Demo (begins when ~START DEMO~ appears in minibuffer):
  
  [[file:static/helm-projectile/helm-projectile-find-file-ediff.gif][file:static/helm-projectile/helm-projectile-find-file-ediff.gif]]

- /Ediff Merge File/ (*C-c =*): Start an Emerge session between
  selected files. Similar to ~Ediff file~ action: if one or more than
  two file are marked, prompts for another file. If exactly two files
  are selected, start an ~Emerge~ session.

- /Etags/ (*M-.*): Invoke Etags using Helm. You can switch back to
  =helm-projectile-find-file= by pressing *C-c p f* while inside a
  Helm Etags session. If exists a symbol at point, only lists matches
  that contain the symbol.

  Demo (begins when ~START DEMO~ appears in minibuffer):

  [[file:static/helm-projectile/helm-projectile-etags.gif][file:static/helm-projectile/helm-projectile-etags.gif]]

- /Switch to Eshell/ (*M-e*): Open Eshell in directory of the
  currently selected candidate. If selected candidate is a file, open
  the directory of that file; if selected candidate is a
  directory. open that directory.

- /Eshell command on file(s)/ (*M-!*): Run an Eshell command on a
  marked candidates. If Eshell aliases exist, provides completion for
  those aliases.

- /Symlink files(s)/ (*M-S*): Create symbolic link, using absolute
  path. If another buffer is available, choose the directory of that
  buffer as destination, similar to ~Rename files(s)~ action.

- /Relsymlink file(s)/: Create symbolic link, using relative path. If
  another buffer is available, choose the directory of that buffer as
  destination, similar to ~Rename files(s)~ action.

- /Hardlink file(s)/ (*M-H*): Create hard link. If another buffer is
  available, choose the directory of that buffer as destination,
  similar to ~Rename files(s)~ action.

- /Checksum File/: Generate file checksum and insert the checksum
  ~kill-ring~.

- /Print File/ (*C-c p*, add *C-u* to refresh): Print marked files.

** Command: ~helm-projectile-find-file-dwim~, *C-c p g*
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       5fcd616f-a139-4c0a-a4ff-5e2c435d08a3
:END:
_Usage_: Find file based on context at point (do what you mean):

- If the command finds just a file, it switches to that file
  instantly. This works even if the filename is incomplete, but
  there's only a single file in the current project that matches the
  filename at point. For example, if there's only a single file named
  "projectile/projectile.el" but the current filename is
  "projectile/proj" (incomplete), the command still switches to
  "projectile/projectile.el" immediately because this is the only
  filename that matches.

- If it finds a list of files, the list is displayed for selecting. A
  list of files is displayed when a filename appears more than one in
  the project or the filename at point is a prefix of more than two
  files in a project. For example, if `projectile-find-file' is
  executed on a path like "projectile/", it lists the content of that
  directory. If it is executed on a partial filename like
  "projectile/a", a list of files with character 'a' in that directory
  is presented.

- If it finds nothing, display a list of all files in project for
  selecting.

This command is demonstrated at the beginning: [[http://tuhdo.github.io/helm-projectile.html#sec-1-2][Open file at point
anywhere]].

** Command: ~helm-projectile-find-dir~, *C-c p d*
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       ff87062c-1e31-4601-89fb-19df0dd01e7b
:END:
_Usage_: List available directories in the current project. 

Available actions:

- /Open Dired in project's directory/: Open the directory in a Dired
  buffer.
- /Switch to Eshell/ (*M-e*): Open the directory in Eshell.
- /Grep in projects/ (*C-s*; add prefix *C-u* for recurse Grep): Run
  ~grep~ on selected directory.

** Command: ~helm-projectile-recentf~, *C-c p e*
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       e6e3eb34-1de4-4d4c-875d-47e94503f572
:END:
_Usage_: List recently visited files in *current project*. The command has a
subset of actions in ~helm-projectile-find-file~, so once you mastered
the actions in ~helm-projectile-find-file~, you can reuse your
knowledge here.

** Command: ~helm-projectile-find-other-file~, *C-c p a*
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       74179568-a5b0-4a8f-8f30-b75959d4e190
:END:
_Usage_: Switch between files with the same name but different extensions. With
prefix argument *C-u*, enable flex-matching that match any file that
contains the name of current file. The command has a subset of actions
in ~helm-projectile-find-file~, so once you mastered the actions in
~helm-projectile-find-file~, you don't need to learn anything else.

Other file extensions can be customized with the variable
~projectile-other-file-alist~.

The command is already demonstrated in the section [[*Switch%20between%20current%20file%20and%20other%20files%20with%20same%20names%20but%20different%20extensions][Switch between
current file and other files with same names but different extensions]].

** Caching
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       5a69b97f-e61f-4633-b6c8-9dc6cc1ac751
:END:
_Usage_: In large projects, caching can significantly speedup file and
directory listings, making it display instantly. Caching is enabled
by:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (setq projectile-enable-caching t)
#+end_src

With caching enabled, even if you use Projectile on your home
directory with 30GB, it lists files instantly.

*** Command: ~projectile-invalidate-cache~
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       e33dd757-4594-466a-b194-ceba73f16b44
:END:
_Usage_: As the command name suggests, it invalidates the current cache and
retrieves everything as new.

*** Command: ~projectile-cache-current-file~
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       ca3915b7-2dc7-49c4-bd7a-194121936f91
:END:
_Usage_: Add the file of current selected buffer to cache.

*** Command: ~projectile-purge-file-from-cache~
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       d8adeaa5-2937-4d4e-a591-dfcf9e8aa8e8
:END:
_Usage_: Remove a file from the cache.

*** Command: ~projectile-purge-dir-from-cache~
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       2cf595ee-dab6-449a-ba49-98094f724ee1
:END:
_Usage_: Remove a directory from the cache.

* Buffer management
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       bc663b21-afa1-4635-9a80-2852d44c8f7f
:END:
** Command: ~helm-projectile-switch-to-buffer~, *C-c p b*
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       d6eea79b-d77a-43e0-84ef-a5d7a157f7b6
:END:
_Usage_: List all opened buffers in *current project*. The command has a
similar subset of actions in ~helm-projectile-find-file~, so once you
mastered the actions in ~helm-projectile-find-file~, except instead of
opening files, you open buffers instead.
